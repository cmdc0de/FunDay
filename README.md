# FunDay
Good Times with ESP 32 and FPGA


# Project 0:
* ESP32 blink simple LED
* Set up Open Logic Analyzer to watch signal change

# Project 1:
* Use ESP32 to start an wifi AP and fetch a web page

# Project 2:
* Use ESP32 to OLED - teaches I2c

# Project 3a:
* Use ESP32 display on LCD and use touch capabilities to move menus

# Project 3b:
* Use touch screen to change color on super LED (APA106) or an RGB LED.

# Project 4:
* Blink LED with FPGA
* Build a clock divider module and blink 2 or 3 different LEDs at different rates

# Project 5:
* esp 32 connected to FPGA, touch a number on the ESP32/LCD Touch screen output a 4 bit number on 4 pins. those 4 pins are connected to FPGA and displays the number on a 7 segment display
