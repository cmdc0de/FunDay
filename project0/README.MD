We will blink a LED.
Materials:
* LED
* resistor: https://ohmslawcalculator.com/led-resistor-calculator to calculate resistor we'll need
	* A red LED typically drops around 1.7 to 2.0 volts, but since both voltage drop and light frequency increase with band gap, a blue LED may drop around 3 to 3.3 volts.
